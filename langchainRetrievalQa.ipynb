This includes information such as the originator and beneficiary of the transaction, as well as the amount and date of the transaction. While there are technological solutions to enable compliance with this rule, it remains a challenge for both the public and private sectors to implement it globally. Currently, only 29 countries have implemented travel rule requirements and only 11 have started enforcing them. The challenge lies in ensuring interoperability between different solutions and addressing issues such as those posed by decentralized finance (DeFi), where the traditional rules of jurisdiction and territorial application may not apply. Additionally, the recently adopted EU regulation, TFR, aims to strengthen AML/CFT rules by imposing travel rule requirements on crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) for every transaction, regardless of amount. This poses a challenge for CASPs to comply with the rule and for regulators to enforce it, especially in the face of DLT-based distributed networks that have no central location.\n"
